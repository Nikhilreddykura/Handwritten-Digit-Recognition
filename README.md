Handwritten Digit Recognition

Project Overview
This project aims to develop a handwritten digit recognition system using machine learning techniques. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits from 0 to 9. The objective is to accurately classify each handwritten digit image into its corresponding digit.


Installation

To run this project, you need to have the following dependencies installed:

Python 3.7+
Jupyter Notebook
NumPy
Pandas
Matplotlib
scikit-learn
TensorFlow or PyTorch (depending on the implementation used in the notebook)
You can install the dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scikit-learn tensorflow
Dataset
The MNIST dataset is used for training and testing the model. You can download the dataset from here.

After downloading, extract the files and place them in the data/ directory.

Usage
Open the Jupyter Notebook:
bash
Copy code
jupyter notebook Handwritten_Digit_Recognition.ipynb
Follow the instructions in the notebook to preprocess the data, train the model, and evaluate its performance.
Model Training
The notebook covers the following steps:

Data Preprocessing: Normalizing the images and converting labels to one-hot encoding.
Model Building: Constructing a neural network using TensorFlow or PyTorch.
Model Training: Training the model on the training dataset.
Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model's performance on the testing dataset using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Visualization: Plotting the training and validation loss and accuracy curves.
Results
The model's performance is evaluated using standard metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The notebook includes visualizations of the training process and the confusion matrix to analyze the model's performance in detail.
